We are a student society, and research group, dedicated to engaging in
rigorous, interdisciplinary medical research. Currently, our work focuses
on urology and several projects are underway to integrate contemporary
technologies, such as artificial intelligence and novel imaging techniques, in
order to improve clinical practice.
